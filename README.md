## Emily is currently in Alpha version and will be officialy released by the end of march 2012.

##What Emily is

 * Emily is a JS library that runs on any JavaScript runtime. It doesn't rely on the DOM.
 * Emily was built to ease the development of real time applications.
 * Emily provides highly reusable code packaged in commonJS modules.
 * Emily is not exclusive, you can use it with other frameworks.
 * Emily is 100% BDD using Jasmine, it has 100% code coverage, it is 100% tested under node.js and recent browsers.
 * Emily doesn't use proprietary technologies, it's 100% standards compliant.
 * Emily is not a tool. It's a set of tools.

##What Emily isn't
 * Emily is not a replacement to existing JS libraries.  
 * Emily is not another way to do stuff that you can do using native features.
 * Emily is not a golden prison, you are free to use any part of it and leave the rest.


##What Can I do with Emily?

 * You can base MVC application on its Store
 * You can use its Transport module to make requests through socket.io
 * You can use both to create observable store that reflect a database, in real time, such as its CouchDBStore.
 * You can use its model and its state machine to start building nice realtime UIs.
 * You can use it with other libraries to create even more awesome stuff!

##How do I get started?

Emily is to be released by the end of march 2012.


Until then the JSDoc is available in the docs/ directory.
There's a demo in my fork of Addy Osmani's Todo app : https://github.com/podefr/todomvc/tree/master/architecture-examples/emily

The only intuitive interface is the nipple. Everything after that is learned.
