# buster-core

[![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/busterjs/buster-core.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/busterjs/buster-core)

Core utilities: some array methods, a few async flow control helpers,
event emitter and other minor things.

Probably a too arbitrary collection of tools for projects that are not
Buster.JS. This module helps keep duplication down when running Buster.JS
in browsers.

# Running tests

To run tests in the browser:

    node_modules/buster-util/jstdhtml

Open test/test.html in a browser

You can also run JsTestDriver from the root directory.
